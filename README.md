Plugin Build Tool - pb_tool
============================
http://g-sherman.github.io/plugin_build_tool

Python command line tool for compiling and deploying QGIS plugins on all OS platforms.


## Features

*pb_tool* provides commands to aid in developing, testing, and deploying
a QGIS Python Plugin:

* Compile resource and UI files
* Deploy to your plugins directory for testing in QGIS
* Create a zip file for upload to a repository
* Clean both compiled and deployed files
* Build and clean documentation
* Build translation files
* Works on Windows, OS X, and Linux

##Installation
You can install the tool using pip:

    pip install pb_tool

To upgrade to the latest version, use:

    pip install --upgrade pb_tool

You can also install using easy_install:

    easy_install pb_tool

For information on getting setup to develop on Windows, see:

##Usage

*pb_tool* requires a configuration file in order to do anything. By default,
*pb_tool* assumes a file name of pb_tool.cfg, although you can specify a
different one using the ``--config`` options in most commands.

To display the available commands, just enter `pb_tool` on the command line:


    $ pb_tool
    Usage: pb_tool [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      Simple Python tool to compile and deploy a QGIS plugin. For help on a
      command use --help after the command: pb_tool deploy --help.

      pb_tool requires a configuration file (default: pb_tool.cfg) that declares
      the files and resources used in your plugin. Plugin Builder 2.6.0 creates
      a config file when you generate a new plugin template.

      See http://g-sherman.github.io/plugin_build_tool for for an example config
      file. You can also use the create command to generate a best-guess config
      file for an existing project, then tweak as needed.

    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      clean       Remove compiled resource and ui files
      cleandocs   Remove the built HTML help files from the...

      translate   Build translations using lrelease.
      update      Check for update to pb_tool

      version     Return the version of pb_tool and exit
      zip         Package the plugin into a zip file suitable...

###Aliases

Every command can be referred to by an unique alias. For example:

 `pb_tool de` is the same as `pb_tool deploy`

Include just enough characters to make it unique.


##Command Help

Here is the help for a few of the commands, as reported using the --help option:

###Compile

    $ pb_tool compile --help
    Usage: pb_tool compile [OPTIONS]

      Compile the resource and ui files

    Options:
      --config TEXT  Name of the config file to use if other than pb_tool.cfg
      --help         Show this message and exit.


###Clean Deployment
    $ pb_tool dclean --help
    Usage: pb_tool dclean [OPTIONS]

      Remove the deployed plugin from the .qgis2/python/plugins directory

    Options:
      --config TEXT  Name of the config file to use if other than pb_tool.cfg
      --help         Show this message and exit.
**Note**: Confirmation is required to remove the plugin

###Clean Compiled Files
    $ pb_tool clean --help
    Usage: pb_tool clean [OPTIONS]

      Remove compiled resource and ui files

    Options:
      --config TEXT  Name of the config file to use if other than pb_tool.cfg
      --help         Show this message and exit.

###Deploy
    $ pb_tool deploy --help
    Usage: pb_tool deploy [OPTIONS]

      Deploy the plugin to QGIS plugin directory using parameters in pb_tool.cfg

    Options:
      --config TEXT  Name of the config file to use if other than pb_tool.cfg
      -q, --quick    Do a quick install without compiling ui, resource, docs,
                     and translation files
      --help         Show this message and exit.
**Note**: Confirmation is required before deploying as it removes the current version.

###Zip
    $ pb_tool zip --help
    Usage: pb_tool zip [OPTIONS]

      Package the plugin into a zip file suitable for uploading to the QGIS
      plugin repository

    Options:
      --config TEXT  Name of the config file to use if other than pb_tool.cfg
      --help         Show this message and exit.

**Note**: To get a clean package for upload to a repository, the zip command
suggests doing a `dclean` and `deploy` first.

###Creating a Config File for an Existing Project
You can create a config file for an existing plugin project by changing to the
directory containing the plugin source and using `pb_tool create`:

    $ pb_tool create --help
    Usage: pb_tool create [OPTIONS]

      Create a config file based on source files in the current directory

    Options:
      --name TEXT  Name of the config file to create if other than pb_tool.cfg
      --help       Show this message and exit.

Once the config file is created you can try `deploy` to see if it
picked up everything needed for your plugin---or open it in your
favorite text editor to tweak it as needed. The config file is annotated
and should be self-explanatory.

####Sample Config

    # Sane defaults for your plugin generated by the Plugin Builder are
    # already set below.
    # 
    # As you add Python source files and UI files to your plugin, add
    # them to the appropriate [files] section below.

    [plugin]
    # Name of the plugin. This is the name of the directory that will
    # be created in .qgis2/python/plugins
    name: TestPlugin

    [files]
    # Python  files that should be deployed with the plugin
    python_files: __init__.py test_plugin.py test_plugin_dialog.py 

    # The main dialog file that is loaded (not compiled)
    main_dialog: test_plugin_dialog_base.ui

    # Other ui files for dialogs you create (these will be compiled)
    compiled_ui_files: foo.ui

    # Resource file(s) that will be compiled
    resource_files: resources.qrc

    # Other files required for the plugin
    extras: icon.png metadata.txt

    # Other directories to be deployed with the plugin.
    # These must be subdirectories under the plugin directory
    extra_dirs: i18n

    # ISO code(s) for any locales (translations), separated by spaces.
    # Corresponding .ts files must exist in the i18n directory
    locales: af

    [help]
    # the built help directory that should be deployed with the plugin
    dir: help/build/html
    # the name of the directory to target in the deployed plugin 
    target: help



##Deploying

    Use ``pb_tool deploy`` to build your plugin and copy it
    to qgis2/python/plugins`` in your HOME directory:


    pb_tool deploy
    Deploying will:
                * Remove your currently deployed version
                * Compile the ui and resource files
                * Build the help docs
                * Copy everything to your .qgis2/python/plugins directory

    Proceed? [y/N]: y
    Removing plugin from /Users/gsherman/.qgis2/python/plugins/TestPlugin
    Deploying to /Users/gsherman/.qgis2/python/plugins/TestPlugin
    Compiling to make sure install is clean
    Skipping foo.ui (unchanged)
    Compiled 0 UI files
    Skipping resources.qrc (unchanged)
    Compiled 0 resource files
    Building the help documentation
    sphinx-build -b html -d build/doctrees   source build/html

    Copying help/build/html to /Users/gsherman/.qgis2/python/plugins/TestPlugin/help



##What's Missing

* `pb_tool` currently doesn't support running tests for your plugin.
* Probably other things we haven't thought of...

##Why?
Why create a build tool when `make` using the Makefile generated by the
Plugin Builder plugin generally works? Here are some reasons:

* `pb_tool` lets you create configs for plugins that were not created using the Plugin Builder plugin
* The Makefile doesn't work completely on Windows in all cases
* Writing a command line tool is fun..
